## Quick Overview

```sh
npm create-react-app burgersorder
cd burgersorder
npm start
```

If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, you need to uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` to ensure that npm always uses the latest version.


## Creating an App
We **do** need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel.<br>
**You’ll need to have Node js on your local development machine**
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder

*Configuration:
Before you run command create-react-app navigate to path you want to creat new folder

```sh
cd BurgerBuilder
create-react-app burgersorde --scripts-version 1.1.5
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.




## What’s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

- React, JSX, ES6.
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.
- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
- An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria. (_Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher_)
